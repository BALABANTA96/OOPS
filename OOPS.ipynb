        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "   - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, which represent real-world entities. Each object encapsulates data (attributes) and behavior (methods), making programs more modular, reusable, and easier to manage.\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "   - A class in OOPS serves as a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior that the objects created from it will have. In essence, a class groups related data (attributes) and functions (methods) into a single unit.\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "   - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is a fundamental building block that represents a real-world entity or concept. It is an instance of a class, which is essentially a blueprint or template. Objects combine data (attributes or properties) and behavior (methods or functions) into a single unit.\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "   - Abstraction: Abstraction focuses on hiding complexity by only exposing essential features of an object or a system.It helps in simplifying the design of a system and allows users to interact with objects or systems at a high level.\n",
        "   - Encapsulation is about hiding the internal details of how an object works and restricting direct access to its components.\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "   - Dunder methods, \"double underscore methods\"(also called magic methods), are special methods in Python with names surrounded by double underscores (e.g., __init__, __str__).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "   - it refers to process of child class receiving the properties of parent class. This facilitates code reusability and establishes a hierarchy between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "   - poly means many and morphism means forms/states. It refers to an object taking several forms depending on the methods/ data.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "   - In Python, encapsulation is achieved by bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) within a class, and controlling access to them using access modifiers. This ensures that the internal details of an object are hidden from the outside world, and interaction with the object is regulated through well-defined interfaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "   - In Python, a constructor is a special method used to initialize objects of a class. It is automatically called when an object is created. The constructor method is named __init__ and is defined within the class definition. Its primary purpose is to set up the initial state of an object by assigning values to its attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "    - A class method can access or modify the class state while a static method can't access or modify it. class method bound to the class but static method doesn't depend on class/instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "    - Method overloading in Python refers to the ability of a single method to perform different operations based on the type or number of arguments passed to it. method overloading happens in the same class.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "    - Method overriding is a concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its parent (or superclass). This is used to change or extend the behavior of the inherited method, making it specific to the subclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "    - In Python, a property decorator (@property) is a built-in feature that allows you to define methods in a class that can be accessed like attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "    - Polymorphism is a cornerstone concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) because it enhances flexibility, scalability, and maintainability in code. Here's why it's so important.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "    - An abstract class in Python is a blueprint for other classes.Abstract classes are designed to be inherited by subclasses, which provide implementations for the abstract methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "    - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) provides a variety of benefits that make it a popular programming paradigm.some of its key advantages:\n",
        "    - Modularity through Classes\n",
        "    - Code Reusability\n",
        "    - Encapsulation\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "    - Class variables and instance variables are both used to store data in a class, but they differ in their scope, usage, and behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "    - Multiple inheritance in Python is a feature of object-oriented programming that allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class. This means that a child class can have access to attributes and methods from multiple classes, combining their functionalities.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        "    - In Python, __str__ and __repr__ are special methods used to define string representations of objects. They serve different purposes and are useful for enhancing the readability and debugging of code.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "    - The super() function in Python is a built-in function that plays a vital role in object-oriented programming. It is used to call a method from a parent (or superclass) within a child (or subclass). This is particularly significant in cases of inheritance, especially when working with multiple inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "    - The __del__ method in Python is a special method, also known as a destructor, that is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It allows you to define cleanup operations, such as releasing resources or performing other necessary finalizations, before the object is deleted from memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "    - In Python, both @staticmethod and @classmethod are decorators used to define methods in a class that are not regular instance methods. They differ in how they interact with the class and its attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "    - Polymorphism in Python works seamlessly with inheritance to allow objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common parent class. It enables you to define methods in the parent class and override them in the child classes, leading to different behaviors based on the objects type.\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "    - Method chaining in Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single statement, forming a chain-like structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "    - In Python, the __call__ method is a special method that allows an instance of a class to be called as if it were a function. This effectively makes the object \"callable\". The purpose of the __call__ method is to provide a way to define custom behavior when an object is invoked like a function.\n",
